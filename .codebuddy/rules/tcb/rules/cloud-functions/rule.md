# Cloud Functions Development

## Activation Contract

### Use this first when

- The task is to create, update, deploy, inspect, or debug a CloudBase Event Function or HTTP Function that serves application runtime logic.
- The request mentions function runtime, function logs, `scf_bootstrap`, function triggers, or function gateway exposure.

### Read before writing code if

- You still need to decide between Event Function and HTTP Function.
- The task mentions `manageFunctions`, `queryFunctions`, `manageGateway`, or legacy function-tool names.
- The task might require `callCloudApi` as a fallback for logs or gateway setup.

### Then also read

- Detailed reference routing -> `./references.md`
- Auth setup or provider-related backend work -> `../auth-tool/SKILL.md`
- AI in functions -> `../ai-model-nodejs/SKILL.md`
- Long-lived container services or Agent runtimes -> `../cloudrun-development/SKILL.md`
- Calling CloudBase official platform APIs from a client or script -> `../http-api/SKILL.md`

### Do NOT use for

- CloudRun container services.
- Web authentication UI implementation.
- Database-schema design or general data-model work.
- CloudBase official platform API clients or raw HTTP integrations that only consume platform endpoints.

### Common mistakes / gotchas

- Picking the wrong function type and trying to compensate later.
- Confusing official CloudBase API client work with building your own HTTP function.
- Mixing Event Function code shape (`exports.main(event, context)`) with HTTP Function code shape (`req` / `res` on port `9000`).
- Treating HTTP Access as the implementation model for HTTP Functions. HTTP Access is a gateway configuration for Event Functions, not the HTTP Function runtime model.
- Forgetting that runtime cannot be changed after creation.
- Using cloud functions as the first answer for Web login.
- Forgetting that HTTP Functions must ship `scf_bootstrap`, listen on port `9000`, and include dependencies.

### Minimal checklist

- Read [Cloud Functions Execution Checklist](checklist.md) before deployment or runtime changes.
- Decide whether the task is Event Function, HTTP Function, or actually CloudRun.
- Pick the detailed reference file in [references.md](references.md) before writing implementation code.

## Overview

Use this skill when developing, deploying, and operating CloudBase cloud functions. CloudBase has two different programming models:

- **Event Functions**: serverless handlers driven by SDK calls, timers, and other events.
- **HTTP Functions**: standard web services for HTTP endpoints, SSE, or WebSocket workloads.

## Writing mode at a glance

- If the request is for SDK calls, timers, or event-driven workflows, write an **Event Function** with `exports.main = async (event, context) => {}`.
- If the request is for REST APIs, browser-facing endpoints, SSE, or WebSocket, write an **HTTP Function** with `req` / `res` on port `9000`.
- If the user mentions HTTP access for an existing Event Function, keep the Event Function code shape and add gateway access separately.

## Quick decision table

| Question | Choose |
| --- | --- |
| Triggered by SDK calls or timers? | Event Function |
| Needs browser-facing HTTP endpoint? | HTTP Function |
| Needs SSE or WebSocket service? | HTTP Function |
| Needs long-lived container runtime or custom system environment? | CloudRun |
| Only needs HTTP access for an existing Event Function? | Event Function + gateway access |

## How to use this skill (for a coding agent)

1. **Choose the correct runtime model first**
   - Event Function -> `exports.main(event, context)`
   - HTTP Function -> web server on port `9000`
   - If the requirement is really a container service, reroute to CloudRun early

2. **Use the converged MCP entrances**
   - Reads -> `queryFunctions`, `queryGateway`
   - Writes -> `manageFunctions`, `manageGateway`
   - Translate legacy names before acting rather than copying them literally

3. **Write code and deploy, do not stop at local files**
   - Use `manageFunctions(action="createFunction")` for creation
   - Use `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionCode")` for code updates
   - Keep `functionRootPath` as the parent directory of the function folder
   - Use CLI only as a fallback when MCP tools are unavailable

4. **Prefer doc-first fallbacks**
   - If a task falls back to `callCloudApi`, first check the official docs or knowledge-base entry for that action
   - Confirm the exact action name and parameter contract before calling it
   - Do not guess raw cloud API payloads from memory

5. **Read the right detailed reference**
   - Event Function details -> `./references/event-functions.md`
   - HTTP Function details -> `./references/http-functions.md`
   - Logs, gateway, env vars, and legacy mappings -> `./references/operations-and-config.md`

## Function types comparison

| Feature | Event Function | HTTP Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary trigger | SDK call, timer, event | HTTP request |
| Entry shape | `exports.main(event, context)` | web server with `req` / `res` |
| Port | No port | Must listen on `9000` |
| `scf_bootstrap` | Not required | Required |
| Dependencies | Auto-installed from `package.json` | Must be packaged with function code |
| Best for | serverless handlers, scheduled jobs | APIs, SSE, WebSocket, browser-facing services |

## Preferred tool map

### Function management

- `queryFunctions(action="listFunctions"|"getFunctionDetail")`
- `manageFunctions(action="createFunction")`
- `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionCode")`
- `manageFunctions(action="updateFunctionConfig")`

### Logs

- `queryFunctions(action="listFunctionLogs")`
- `queryFunctions(action="getFunctionLogDetail")`
- If these are unavailable, read `./references/operations-and-config.md` before any `callCloudApi` fallback

### Gateway exposure

- `queryGateway(action="getAccess")`
- `manageGateway(action="createAccess")`
- If gateway operations need raw cloud API fallback, read `./references/operations-and-config.md` first
